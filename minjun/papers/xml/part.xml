   <ref type="bibr" coords="2,85.83,164.34,7.31,7.06" target="#b24">25</ref> ). Plasma turbulence is significantly altered by the MI itself or a modification of the equilibrium profiles due to its presence. In brief, it increases outside the MI and decreases inside the MI following the pressure gradient. This implies that the turbulent transport around an MI can be also modified, meaning that the evolution of plasma turbulence and the evolution of the MI are coupled. However, there has been relatively little experimental research progress

It is shown that the electron temperature (T e ) turbulence outside an MI is regulated by the flow shear and localized to the limited small region. The inhomogeneous turbulence around an MI would complicate the transport around the MI on which its stability depends. In addition, we present some observations which allow more direct intervention of plasma turbulence in the MI stability. They include turbulence spreading into the MI and the turbulence enhancement at the reconnection site, either retarding or facilitating the magnetic reconnection, respectively. These observations significantly extend our understanding of the nonlinear MI evolution in tokamak as well as provide general insights into the magnetic reconnection physics in magnetized plasmas.



   <div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Measurements of the low-k T e turbulence and the flow shear around an MI in KSTAR experiments revealed that the turbulence is nonlinearly regulated by the flow shear development around the MI and localized to the small region near the X-point. These spatial patterns of the turbulence and the shear flow are in broad agreement with the results from many fluid and gyrokinetic simulations

   <ref type="bibr" coords="5,476.11,645.55,7.25,7.06" target="#b21">22</ref> contains gyrokinetic simulation results based on the equilibrium and profiles of the KSTAR experiment. In spite of some limitations, a main role of the increasing flow shear toward the O-point in suppressing the turbulence was confirmed. Note that, however, different patterns of turbulence and flow were also observed in other experiments, and even a phenomenon which can be interpreted as a transition between strong and weak ω E×B states (low and high accessibility states, respectively) is observed 
   <ref type="bibr" coords="5,470.15,729.23,7.25,7.06" target="#b46">47</ref> . The turbulence suppression around the O-point would have a destabilizing effect on the NTM in tokamak plasmas when magnetic shear is positive. With the suppressed turbulence and reduced heat influx from the inner (hotter) region, the resulting temperature profile would be sharper across the MI boundary and flatter inside the MI than the profile without the turbulence suppression. The flatter profile inside the MI increases the bootstrap current loss and enhance the growth rate of the NTM when magnetic shear is positive. Moreover, an increasing trend of the flow shear with the island width

   <ref type="bibr" coords="6,197.01,412.77,6.46,7.06" target="#b47">48</ref> could form a positive feedback loop for the NTM MI growth.</p><p>When it comes to the NTM, it would be worth introducing that in the recent DIII-D experiment 
   <ref type="bibr" coords="6,170.53,444.12,7.25,7.06" target="#b33">34</ref> a nonlinear three-wave coupling between the broadband (60-150 kHz) density turbulence and an m/n = 2/1 NTM MI is observed

The squared bicoherence using the wavelet transform 
   <ref type="bibr" coords="6,149.10,517.37,7.25,7.06" target="#b48">49</ref> is calculated to study the nonlinear coupling in the density fluctuations, and the result for one short period is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="6,132.83,539.90,7.68,8.82" target="#fig_6">6d</ref>. The significant squared bicoherence is observed between the ~20 kHz NTM and the 60-150 kHz turbulence, demonstrating the existence of a nonlinear three-wave coupling among them. The temporal evolution of the strength of this coupling is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="6,163.28,581.75,8.47,8.82" target="#fig_6">6c</ref> by the summed squared bicoherence (b 2 tot ), which is sporadic and the strongest when the island width is intermediate not when it is the largest. Previous understanding on the interaction between density turbulence and an NTM MI relied on the pressure profile variation by the island growth <ref type="bibr" coords="6,70.41,632.12,3.63,7.06" target="#b5">6</ref> , but this observation suggests that additional mechanism such as the nonlinear beating 50 could be also important in the NTM evolution. Further experiments and analyses would be required to better identify its role in the NTM evolution definitely.</p><p>In tokamak plasmas, the evolution of a tearing mode MI is often described by a modified Rutherford equation <ref type="bibr" coords="6,234.48,694.88,7.35,7.06" target="#b50">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,241.83,694.88,3.67,7.06" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,245.50,694.88,7.35,7.06" target="#b52">[53]</ref> . Recently, many efforts have been made to develop an advanced model which can include the multi-scale and multi-physics interaction between a large scale MI and small scale turbulence as reviewed in reference <ref type="bibr" coords="6,338.12,318.61,7.25,7.06" target="#b23">24</ref> . Observations introduced in this article suggest that the model should be able to cover the nonlinear turbulence regulation by the shear flow development, the non-local effects of turbulence spreading <ref type="bibr" coords="6,383.41,350.01,7.31,7.06" target="#b38">39</ref> , an energy exchange between a low (m,n) mode and high (m,n) modes via a three-wave coupling as well as the anomalous resistivity by turbulence.</p><p>The anomalous enhancement of resistivity by turbulence <ref type="bibr" coords="6,529.06,381.36,7.31,7.06" target="#b53">54</ref> has been considered as one model to explain the fast timescale of reconnection events universally observed in magnetized plasmas <ref type="bibr" coords="6,318.90,412.77,7.25,7.06" target="#b54">55</ref> , since it can increase the dissipation rate of magnetic field and broaden the current sheet to facilitate the mass outflow. Increase of the T e turbulence at the X-point shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="6,529.97,435.25,4.53,8.82" target="#fig_5">5</ref> and its correlation with the fast plasma disruption can be a supporting evidence for that mechanism. The correlated increase of the fluctuation power during the fast magnetic reconnection in laboratory plasmas was also reported in reference <ref type="bibr" coords="6,501.28,475.53,7.25,7.06" target="#b55">56</ref> where the fluctuation is electromagnetic. On the other hand, another mechanism to explain the fast reconnection is based on the formation of secondary islands, or plasmoids, on a thin current sheet which becomes tearing unstable <ref type="bibr" coords="6,431.83,517.37,7.37,7.06" target="#b56">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,439.20,517.37,3.68,7.06" target="#b57">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,439.20,517.37,3.68,7.06" target="#b58">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,442.88,517.37,7.37,7.06" target="#b59">[60]</ref> . Successive formation of plasmoid-like structures during reconnection events were observed in various conditions such as the magnetotail <ref type="bibr" coords="6,525.60,538.29,7.25,7.06" target="#b60">61</ref> and laboratory plasmas <ref type="bibr" coords="6,375.36,548.72,9.73,7.06" target="#b61">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,385.09,548.72,6.48,7.06" target="#b62">63</ref> . In the KSTAR experiment <ref type="bibr" coords="6,496.18,548.72,7.25,7.06" target="#b61">62</ref> , coalescence of plasmoid-like structures (cold bubbles) with an m/n = 2/1 MI lead to the explosive major disruption. The cold bubbles were formed near the X-point of an m/n = 2/1 MI and the MI expanded by merging with the bubbles which convect towards the plasma center <ref type="bibr" coords="6,358.41,601.05,7.25,7.06" target="#b61">62</ref> . It may be understandable that the low-k T e turbulence discussed in this article was not observed in that case.</p><p>In summary, this article reports on various effects of plasma turbulence on the nonlinear MI evolution.
